reminder:
- auto expand today's alert only?
- should have animations that's about to trigger?
- notification part
- sync up alert part

need to check on validation:
multiple tabs -> what if I change one content, another tab? Need to sync? or just throw error?

future todo:

make sorted by updated / created configurable

alert smart sort:
base on today, prioritize days after today within a week.
then prioritize days before a week
? make it configurable? searchabe?
